# Overview
2024 August Update: Someone sent me the slides from the briefing of this semester, this repository, along with my other MDP-related ones, are entirely STILL reusable as far as I can see. SCSE can become CCDS but MDP is still MDP. As usual, retrain the YOLO model (or use something more recent la). Once again, that is a 1-day thing. If you are using these repositories and you don't have a functioning, fully-integrated system by end of Week 4, reconsider your life choices and your peer evaluations.

This repository contains the code for the simulator component of the CZ3004/SC2079 Multidisciplinary Project. It was built in React, Next.js, & TailwindCSS. 

**2023 Semester 1 Update**: At least from what my juniors told me, this repository, along with my other MDP-related ones, are entirely reusuable. The only exception is that you will need to retrain the YOLO model since the fonts/colors were changed. That is a 1-day thing. If you are using these repositories and you don't have a functioning, fully-integrated system by end of Week 4, reconsider your life choices.



## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

Start the app by

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be running at `localhost:3000`

## Usage

The interface is as intuitive as it can get. Position the robot where you want it to be and click on the buttons to add obstacles. Then click on `Submit` to find the path, or `Reset All` to clear the map and put the robot back to the starting position. `Reset Robot` just resets the robot to the starting position without clearing the map.

You can also add obstacles without a symbol card by choosing the 'None' option for the direction.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/3.jpg" alt="Interface" width=350 ></div>

Use the left and right arrow buttons to go through the path step by step to see how the algorithm is working.

Of course, sometimes you might think it's not going by the shortest path possible, but that's because of the various constraints and safeguards in the algorithm, which can all be tweaked in the code.

The algorithm API server should be running at a specific address, which you will need to change in `BaseAPI.js`. To see a working simulator with an online API (online for now at least), visit [here](https://mdp.pyesonekyaw.com/).

# Acknowledgements

I used [Group 28](https://github.com/CZ3004-Group-28)'s simulator as a boilerplate and improved it significantly, such as adding no-direction obstacles, being able to change the robot's starting position, and revamped the user interface to make it more modern and intuitive.
